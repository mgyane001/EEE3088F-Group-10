• To operate 2 motors with the pins available to you (listed in Table 3). You will need to
control 2x motors which could each draw 200mA at the highest voltage of a 1S1P battery
(the battery is further specified in the battery section).
• Needs to provide an analog connection that provides information on the battery's voltage
for the processor to sense battery state of charge (SoC).
• Needs to charge the battery from the 5V input pin (listed in Table 3). Hint: What happens
when 5V removed?
• Needs an ON/OFF switch. OFF state: battery draw <500uA. ON state: your robot peak
current.
